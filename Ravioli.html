    <h3><i>Step #1: Make Pasta Dough</i></h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>There are several ways to make fresh pasta dough. The food processor method is the fastest. To do so: add the flour, eggs and olive oil to a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Process to form dough, about 15-20 seconds. Remove to your work surface and cover with an upturned bowl for 5 minutes- it will be much easier to knead in the next step.</p></li>
        <li><p>Knead dough for 1-2 minutes to form a ball (donâ€™t worry about technique here, the food processor does most of the kneading for you) cover again, and let rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour to relax the gluten. Use this time to make the ravioli filling.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <h3><i></i>Step #2: Make Ravioli Filling</i></h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>While the pasta dough is resting: combine the drained ricotta, mascarpone, chopped basil leaves, Parmesan cheese and egg. Season with salt and pepper; mix well. Give it a taste (it should be highly seasoned). Cover and chill until ready to use. This step can be done 1-2 days in advance.
